This is an option for batch processing.

Batch processing uses Long Running Operations to manage requests in an asynchronous manner, so we have to make the request and retrieve the output in a different manner than online processing. However, the output will be in the same Document object format whether using online or batch processing.

This step shows how to provide specific documents for Document AI to process. A later step will show how to process an entire directory of documents.

For the moment, I do not use but maybe I will in the future.
